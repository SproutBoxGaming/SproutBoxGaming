    <h1>Hell Let Loose - Brutal, Tactical and Brilliant</h1>
    <p class="review-meta">Reviewed on Xbox Series X | April 2025</p>

    <p>
      <em>Hell Let Loose</em> is not your average run-and-gun FPS. It’s a hardcore, 50v50 multiplayer shooter set in World War II that demands teamwork, communication, and patience.
    </p>

    <h2>⚔️ Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
      Battles are massive and slow-paced compared to arcade-style shooters. Players choose between roles like Commander, Medic, Rifleman, or Tank Crew — each with unique responsibilities. Strategy, rather than reflex, wins the day.
    </p>

    <h2>🎮 Xbox Optimization</h2>
    <p>
      The Xbox version runs smoothly at 60 FPS on Series X. The controls are tight, and the UI has been adapted fairly well for console users. While the learning curve is steep, the immersion makes it worth the effort.
    </p>

    <h2>🔥 Verdict</h2>
    <p><strong>9/10</strong> — For fans of realism and tactical coordination, <em>Hell Let Loose</em> is an unforgettable experience on Xbox. But casual players might find the lack of solo-friendly content a barrier.</p>
